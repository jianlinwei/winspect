= Introduction =

The goal of WInspect project is to build simple (but extensible) traffic monitoring application using Windows Filtering Platform infrastructure.
This project is educational one and intended to study WFP mechanisms.

= Details =

Basic concepts:
  1) Traffic monitoring application consists of two modules: kernel-space   
     module (driver) and user-space control application;
  2) The driver should provide filtering and rule-based taks;
  3) The control application should provide dispatching of user's commands
     to the driver (such as new filtering rules) and receive feedback from
     driver.

Tools used:
  1) Microsoft Visual Stidio 2010;
  2) Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0.

OS and harware requirements:
  1) OS type: Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.
  2) Hardware type: any x86 IBM-compatible system which is capable to
     run Windows 7.
